Project Overview
The project analyzes voting patterns, turnout, and other essential metrics for the 2019 Nigerian Presidential Election. With a focus on the two major political parties—All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)—this project explores regional voting differences and offers a holistic view of the election results across Nigeria's geopolitical zones.

Installation and Setup
Power BI and Excel was used to analyze the Data Set. 

Data Analysis Process

1. Data Preprocessing using the ETL protocol.
•	Data Cleaning: Ensuring no missing values, inconsistencies, or errors.
•	Feature Selection: Selecting essential features such as total votes, valid votes, rejected votes, APC and PDP votes.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Voter Participation: Analyzing metrics like voter turnout, total votes cast and rejected votes.
•	Regional Voting Patterns: Breaking down votes by each geopolitical zone.
•	Party Performance: Visualizing and comparing vote counts between APC and PDP across states.

3. Visualization
•	KPIs: Show key indicators from the dataset.
•	Bar Charts: Visualize party results in each geopolitical zone.
•	Maps: Highlight states won by each party.

Results and Visualizations
The analysis provides various visual representations:
1.	Election Outcome by Party: A clear summary of APC, PDP, and other parties' total votes.
2.	Geopolitical Zone Breakdown: A bar chart showing valid votes per zone, indicating regional preferences.
3.	Voter Participation Analysis: A breakdown of registered, accredited, and actual voters.
4.	State-Wise Vote Distribution: A map visual showing states won by APC and PDP.

Conclusion
The 2019 Nigerian Presidential Election demonstrates varying political alignments across Nigeria’s regions. APC’s majority win was primarily driven by high support in the northern zones, whereas PDP performed strongly in specific states, particularly in the south. This analysis offers insights into the impact of regional voting patterns on national elections, providing valuable context for political strategists, analysts, and other stakeholders.

Future Work
Potential extensions of this analysis could include:
•	Comparative Analysis: Analyze previous election data to observe trends over time.
•	Sentiment Analysis: Integrate social media sentiment data to correlate public opinion with actual voting outcomes.
